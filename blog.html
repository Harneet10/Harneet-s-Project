                Dodge is an only brand which equipped an V8 engine with supercharger into all of its top the line sports cars.
                Both the Dodge Charger and the Dodge Challenger have a lot to offer if you're looking for a powerful and sporty vehicle.
                Perhaps the biggest difference between the two is simply the number of doors.
                While the Dodge Charger is a four-door sedan that seats up to five, the Challenger fits the same number of people in a two-door coupe.
                For starters, the base engine on the 2022 Dodge Challenger is a V6 305-horsepower option.
                However, you can easily upgrade this to a Hemi 48 engine that produces 375 horsepower or a 6.4-liter V8 engine that produces a whopping 485 horsepower.

           <img align = right src="4.jpg" width="250px" height="140px">
            The 2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk is an expletive-inducing thrill ride that would have gotten Clark Griswold and family to Wally World a lot sooner while still doubling Sparky's swears.
             With a 707-hp supercharged Hellcat V-8 under the hood, it's not only the most powerful Jeep ever built, it's one of the most powerful SUVs in the world. 
             While the Trackhawk can't keep up with most sports cars at the racetrack, it can outrun some of the best of them in a straight line.
             Now, it does cost roughly three times as much as a base Grand Cherokee Laredo but its prodigious performance makes its almost $90K price tag look like it's from the clearance section compared with the Porsche Cayenne Turbo and Mercedes-AMG GLE63 S.
             Despite its extroverted exterior and roaring exhaust note, the 2021 Grand Cherokee Trackhawk isn't all fire and brimstone.
             If fact, it has a leather-covered cabin, all the latest technology, useful cargo space, and the ability to tow 7200 pounds.
             Who could imagine an suv with that amount of power. Person with children could easily use it for his daily and with an switch of button drag race it.
             Its an true from of SUV with fun.

        <p><h3 style="font-family:'septacharge'; font-size: 22px;"><u>5. CHEVROLET CAMARO ZL1</u>  </h3>
       <img align = right src="5.jpg" width="250px" height="140px">
            The 2022 Chevrolet Camaro coupe and convertible are about the pure and simple joy of driving.
             Forget about their compromised outward visibility and cramped rear seats. Instead, embrace their lithe handling, satisfying stick-shift transmission, and remarkably smooth ride. 
             A 275-hp turbo four is the default engine, but opting for the 335-hp V-6 or the 455-hp V-8 unlocks more melodic soundtracks and punchier acceleration. 
             Its cabin includes some unattractive materials, and some will call it claustrophobic, but its front seats are comfy and supportive, and its well-stocked infotainment system is easy to use.
              The Ford Mustang and Dodge Challenger are better as daily drivers, but with the optional 1LE package, Chevy's pony car transforms into the best track car of the three.
             When it comes to performance for the price, it's hard to find a better value than the 2022 Camaro.
             The Camaro's supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 is a well-behaved and tractable beast that makes power all over the rev range and leaves black streaks all over the road. 
             As you'd expect, when stirred up, it leaves the sound of thunder echoing in its wake. Whether paired with the standard six-speed manual transmission or the available 10-speed automatic, the supercharged small-block V-8 lays down stupidly incredible performance figures. 
             The fast-shifting automatic results in quicker acceleration times than the stick, but either way, this Chevy is a demon at the drag strip.
